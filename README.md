## My camera is turning on it's own! (Gyro Drift)
Put your controller down on a flat surface and hold down the calibration button for a second or two (click the touchpad by default) without moving the controller.
To avoid this next time, leave the controller down while launching the game. It calibrates automatically on every launch.
